{"molecule": "Paracetamol", "parsed_xtb_output": "Here are the key information extracted from the xTB output for Paracetamol:\n\n- Total energy (in Hartree): -32.75926\n- HOMO-LUMO gap (in eV): 3.46013\n\nPlease note, as per standard output of xTB, Enthalpy and Free Energy are not directly provided in the output.\nFor these quantities, the specific method or approach to compute these should be employed, which can be subsequent thermodynamic or statistical mechanical calculations based on the energy and the molecular structure. The contributions of temperature (for Enthalpy) and entropy (for Gibbs Free Energy) can then be determined."}
